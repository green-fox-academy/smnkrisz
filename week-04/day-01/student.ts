// Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional

// fields:
// previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
// skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course

// methods:
// getGoal(): prints out "My goal is: Be a junior software developer."
// introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
// skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays

// The Student class has the following constructors:
// Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
// Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0
